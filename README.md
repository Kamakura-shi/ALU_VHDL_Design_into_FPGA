This VHDL testbench (UAL_tb.vhd) is designed to verify a 32-bit arithmetic and logic unit (UAL) by reading input vectors from ual_entrees.txt and writing simulation results to ual_sorties.txt. It supports multiple operation types (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, SLT) and compares UAL outputs (result, zero, cout) against expected values to determine success or failure. The testbench can be used with different vector generation strategies such as compteurs, force, al√©atoire, and fichiersTexte. 

To simulate with a custom bit width (e.g., 16 bits), pass -gN=16 as a generic during simulation with ModelSim, e.g., vsim -gui work.UAL_tb -gN=16. All output is formatted with helpful commentary for analysis and debugging.
